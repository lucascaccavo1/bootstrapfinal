        <p>Loughnatousa Titus</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Loughnatousa Titus was an imported tall dark and handsome 16.3  hand Black Irish Sport Horse.  He was kind to riders of all ages, shapes, and sizes, and could even be used as a therapy horse.  There are very few horses in the world who can safely carry around disabled children and get ribbons in 1.10M jumper classes with an AA rider against stiff competition from professionals, and he was one of those gems.  He craved human attention, and would do anything to get it, including being the most incredible escape artist we have ever met, and as such, he ended up on our doorstep many times.  </p>
        
        <p>He deserves to be remembered as a very special horse who always tried hard and never complained, even though he had an undiagnosed developmental and degenerative condition which had to have made it difficult for him to carry on without complaint, and which ended his life far too early.   May you be able to gallop fast, jump high, and run free with Zoe, Titus!   From his favorite person ever, Carrie France:  "Much love to the best teacher, patient friend, lovable trouble maker and kind soul that was Titus."</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">"Ride of a Lifetime" Book</h2>
      

        <p>“Ride of a Lifetime” is the story of Cynthia "Tootie" Anderson's lifetime journey with horses, and with one mare in particular.  At a low ebb in Tootie's life, a big chestnut mare named Zoe entered and turned Tootie's world around.  Horse lovers as well as those who don’t have any experience with horses will enjoy this book about joy, sadness, redemption, giving, and loving. Readers will also feel the raw emotions Tootie experienced when she had to overcome more obstacles than one could count, and conversely will ride right alongside her to experience her highs and success. There is something in it for everyone as it is a true “underdog takes all” story, but any junior or adult amateur who has had struggles in the horse world is sure to identify with some part of the story and love it!</p>

        <p>"Our son has done hippotherapy since he was 1 and a half years old.  He said his first words on a horse and he walked two weeks after his first hippotherapy session.  Needless to say, we are firm believers in the benefits provided by therapy with a horse and a trained therapist like Tootie!  We have done hippotherapy with Tootie for two summers now.  She finds a great balance between pushing our child to produce results while at the same time making it a fun experience for him.  He loves the experience, we see results, it is a win-win situation!"

            --Mother of a son with Dup15q and Autism</p>
        
        <p>"The care that Tootie provides at Optimus Farm is wonderful, and her dedication and attention to detail with regard to horses, horsemanship and horse health issues is phenomenal. Several years ago, I was unexpectedly forced to leave the only boarding facility I had ever used. During my search for a new home for my horse, I was lucky enough to find Journey’s End, a great place for us. Jake was a very special rescue horse who was treated like a king there. After he passed away, Tootie successfully helped me to find my next horse, J.B.. I would recommend her services to any horse person in need of help!''
