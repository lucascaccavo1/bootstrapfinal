        <p class="text-body-secondary">Ozzy is a 7 y/o 16 hand Imported from Ireland Irish OTTB Gelding who looks like today's modern warmblood with thicker bone than the average TB, and has had nothing but professional training since coming off the track 2 years ago.  Extreme care has been taken in training him slowly and methodically, and he is now ready for his forever partner in crime! His 1st ride on the farm was on 3.14.22, and he has come a long way since then.  Ozzy is a spur ride for dressage, yet he is very forward and athletic for jumping, and as such he is not for a beginner.  </p>

            <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-0 text-body-emphasis">Personality</h4>
            <p class="text-body-secondary">Since he was trained to be a Steeplechaser in Ireland, he has jumped the massive 5 rail fences at speed, and he is a xc machine.  Ozzy is a super personable, sweet, and outgoing horse who loves his people.  He will entertain the masses with his tongue tricks.  He loves to snuggle and wants to be a lap dog.  He is great for the farrier, vet, bathing, clipping, trailering, etc.  A super bonus is that he is a very easy keeper.  He even needs to wear a muzzle during turn out to limit grass intake because he gets fat on air.  Recently, he even gave a non rider friend who is dealing with breast cancer a safe supervised pony ride.    </p>

Ozzy's last event was at Hunt Club's Eventing for the Cure event on 11/11/23.   He scored 28.9 in dressage, had one rail in show jumping (which was 100% rider error) and was easily and  confidently double clear in xc.  He is offered for $26,000 until he goes to Aiken.  Price to significantly increase once he completes at Training level.</p>
